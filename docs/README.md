<h2>The Current Situation</h2>
Sometimes, we go to a restaurant and wish we could see the item in front of our eyes, on our table before ordering, to help us in deciding what quantity of the item to order so that neither the food is wasted nor we stay hungry even after eating. Also, it is human tendency to classify food after seeing it. What looks good, must taste good, is what we think. This is a common problem and we solely rely on the waiter's estimates.
<br><br><h2>The Solution</h2>
Tilted AR Restaurant will show the food item right on the table, a 3D model of the item visible in our smartphones which will be of exact same size as the real item which will not only help the customers to decide the quantity of the food item, but also if it should be ordered or something more handsome.
<br>For the restaurant, it may be much more beneficial than the customers. Wastage disposal is a problem for them. But when the customers use Tilted AR Restaurant, they will order only that much food which will be enough for them and hence, lesser waste will be generated. Also, when the customers will see a number of beautiful eatables, they will try more items and pay more to the restaurant, increasing the profits.

<br><br><h2>How does it work</h2>
When the customer visits the restaurant, the restaurant will provide them with their menu (which should be of standard size as the menu is of utmost importance) and the customers, by using Tilted AR Restaurant, will show the menu in the smartphone's camera and select the item which they wish to order. After selecting, a 3D model of that item will be projected on the menu. Now, the customer can see the item and decide. Simple and sweet.
